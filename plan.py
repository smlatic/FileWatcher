What the app needs to do:

1. Monitor a folder for files
    - Check if the file size is changing ( 5second check )
    - Display the file that is changing as an Popup alarm.
    - Be able to resize the alarm and the font size should increase/decrease as it is resized by dragging it in the corner.
    - The alarm should always display the latest file 
    - The alarm should turn with a red background when the file size stops changing, and while its changing it should be green.
        This is to indicate that is logging the current file.
    - There should be a button to view history of the previous file in a list.


2. The app should be very minimalistic. 3 Buttons "Config" and "FileHistory" and "Save Setup". 
This will open a new window, where you select to add alarm and then what to track by chosing the folder location. 
There should be an option also to delete an alarm in the config.

3. App will be made in python, and a tkinter gui.
